MSE enables the three following security scenarios.
The scenario is selected through the settings of the app configuration file.

## Zero trust: confidential collaborative computation (CCC)

In this scenario, no participant trusts any other participant.
A real-world example is generation of anonymized biomarkers in Healthcare: extraction of medical biomarkers from patient data while keeping the patient data private:

![](./images/zero-trust-scenario.png)

The Biotech company (_app owner_) wishes to keep its biomarker selection code private from everyone.

The hospital (_app user_) doesn't want to share its identified data with anyone.

!!! info "It's the **default mode** of the `deploy` subcommand."

## App owner trusted: fully encrypted SaaS

In this scenario, the app user trusts the app owner.
A real-world example is a bank wishing to move to the cloud and securely operate its online
banking application in the cloud:

![](./images/fes-scenario.png)

The bank (_app owner_) wishes to keep its code private from Cosmian (the operator) and from the cloud provider.

The bank's customer (_app user_) trusts the bank: the bank already has its data in clear text.
However, the customer and the bank wish to keep the data private from the operator and the cloud provider.

!!! info "The app owner has to provide an SSL certificate when deploying its application, using the `ssl` paragraph in the config file."

## Operator and app owner trusted: quick start dev

In this scenario, the app user trusts Cosmian (the operator), the app owner but not the cloud provider.

|                      | Cloud provider | Cosmian | App owner | A third party |
| :------------------: | :------------: | :-----: | :-------: | :-----------: |
| The app owner trusts |       ‚ùå       |   ‚ùå    |    NA     |      ‚ùå       |
| The app user trusts  |       ‚ùå       |   ‚úÖ    |    ‚úÖ     |      ‚ùå       |

This scenario is interesting for developers wishing to quickly test their applications without being bothered by any SSL generation or by DNS configuration.

!!! info "The app owner has to set `dev=true` in the config file, before deploying its application ."

## MSE security features

An MSE node is built on top of an Intel SGX enclave.
SGX enables running an app in a fully isolated environment, where the filesystem and the memory are fully encrypted, using a hidden secret engraved in the CPU.
MSE implements the following additional security features:

|                        Feature                        | Zero trust CCC | Fully encrypted SaaS | Quick start dev |
| :---------------------------------------------------: | :------------: | :------------------: | :-------------: |
|    Code encryption when deploying to the MSE node     |       ‚úÖ       |          ‚úÖ          |       ‚úÖ        |
| Code & Data encrypted while running (on disk/on ram)  |       ‚úÖ       |          ‚úÖ          |       ‚úÖ        |
| App owner can verify the MSE instance when deploying  |       ‚úÖ       |          ‚úÖ          |       ‚úÖ        |
| User can verify the MSE instance before using the app |       ‚úÖ       |          ‚ùå          |       ‚ùå        |
|        Full protection of User queries & data         |       ‚úÖ       |     üëÅÔ∏è App Owner     |   üëÅÔ∏è Cosmian    |
|      App is directly callable from a web browser      |       ‚ùå       |          ‚úÖ          |       ‚úÖ        |

Verification of the MSE instance mainly consists in:

- verifying that the environment uses an actual SGX enclave (and not some simulator) through a process called remote attestation
- verifying that the correct code, and other components of the software stack, are running inside the enclave
